# Crypto Volating Trading Bot

## Description
This crypto trading bot monitors price fluctuations across all coins on Binance and trades on the most volatile ones. It tracks purchased coins and executes sales based on user-defined Stop Loss and Take Profit settings.

The bot specifically monitors USDT pairs, excluding Margin and Fiat pairs.

Configurable example settings include:

- The bot checks if any coin has increased by more than 3% in the past 5 minutes.
- It buys 100 USDT of the most volatile coins.
- It sells at a 8% profit or a 3% stop loss.

## READ BEFORE USE
1. If you use the `TEST_MODE: False` in your config, you will be using REAL money.
2. To ensure you do not do this, ALWAYS check the `TEST_MODE` configuration item in the config.yml file..
3. This is a framework for users to modify and adapt to their overall strategy and needs, and in no way a turn-key solution.
4. Depending on the current market, the default config might not do much, so you will have to adapt it to your own strategy.
